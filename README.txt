I have decided to rename my Doom 3 repository (aka "idTech4 ES2.0", aka
"Oliver's Doom", aka "omcfadde's Doom", ...) to an easier to remember name.

Going forward, the repository will be named "Dante" (based on Dante's Inferno
and it's fitting description of the Doom 3 game.) Dante journeyed through
Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil.

Hopefully this will make it much easier to uniquely and easily identify my
repository. Unfortunately for those of you who already have clones of the
idTech4 repository from Github, you will need to adjust the remote origin to
point to the new address. I apologize for any inconvenience.

Don't worry, the project is continuing as usual; the only change is the
repository name. :-)
